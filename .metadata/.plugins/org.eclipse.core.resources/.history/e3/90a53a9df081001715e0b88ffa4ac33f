/**
 * Given a grid with each cell consisting of positive, negative or no points i.e, zero points. We can move across a cell only if we have positive points ( > 0 ). Whenever we pass through a cell, points in that cell are added to our overall points. We need to find minimum initial points to reach cell (m-1, n-1) from (0, 0).

Constraints :

From a cell (i, j) we can move to (i+1, j) or (i, j+1).
We cannot move from (i, j) if your overall points at (i, j) is <= 0.
We have to reach at (n-1, m-1) with minimum positive points i.e., > 0.
