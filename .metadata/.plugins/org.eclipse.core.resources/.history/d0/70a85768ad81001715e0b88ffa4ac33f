/**
 * Given a n*n matrix where all numbers are distinct, find the maximum length
 * path (starting from any cell) such that all cells along the path are in
 * increasing order with a difference of 1.
 * 
 * We can move in 4 directions from a given cell (i, j), i.e., we can move to
 * (i+1, j) or (i, j+1) or (i-1, j) or (i, j-1) with the condition that the
 * adjacent cells have a difference of 1.
 * 
 * 
 * solution for each cell calculate path length and return max but there will be
 * a lot of overlaping in this case so use memoization
